1. Project Overview

Project Title: Quiz App
Language: Java
File Handling: Java IO (BufferedReader, BufferedWriter)
Architecture: DAO Pattern (Data Access Object)
Interface: Console-based (Text UI)

This Quiz App allows users to add, update, delete, view, and attempt quiz questions. All data is persistently stored using file handling mechanisms. It follows good programming practices using object-oriented principles and modularity.

2. Core Features Implemented

Feature	Description
Add Question	Adds a new question to the text file
List Questions	Displays all questions with ID, text, and answer
Update Question	Updates question text and answer based on ID
Delete Question	Removes a question using its ID
Take Quiz	Presents all questions and calculates the user‚Äôs score

3. Architecture & Components

A. Question Class:
	‚Ä¢	Encapsulates the id, questionText, and answer.
	‚Ä¢	Implements getter/setter methods and toString() for file formatting.

B. QuestionDAO Class:
	‚Ä¢	Handles all file operations: read, write, update, and delete.
	‚Ä¢	Maintains decoupling between business logic and file system.

C. QuizApp Class:
	‚Ä¢	Main class with Scanner UI for user interaction.
	‚Ä¢	Includes menu-driven navigation and input validation.

4. Event Handling and Processing
	‚Ä¢	switch-case menu system for handling user choices.
	‚Ä¢	Input is dynamically processed and fed into logic blocks.
	‚Ä¢	Events like quiz attempt, deletion, update are triggered based on user input.

‚∏ª

5. Data Validation
	‚Ä¢	Validates integer ID input with error handling.
	‚Ä¢	Ensures non-empty string input for questions and answers.
	‚Ä¢	Validates the existence of a question before update/delete.

‚∏ª

6. Error Handling and Robustness
	‚Ä¢	All I/O operations wrapped with try-catch blocks.
	‚Ä¢	Graceful handling of malformed data.
	‚Ä¢	File creation and directory checks in QuestionDAO constructor.

‚∏ª

7. Innovative Features
	‚Ä¢	Enhanced user interaction with emojis for feedback (‚úÖ‚ùåüéØ).
	‚Ä¢	Quiz logic compares answers case-insensitively.
	‚Ä¢	Shuffled questions for variety in quiz attempt.

8. Possible Enhancements (Optional)

Feature	Description
GUI Interface	Swing/JavaFX-based GUI for better UX
Categories	Add categories/tags to questions
Scores Storage	Save quiz scores per user
Timer	Add timed quizzes
Unit Tests	Add JUnit tests for DAO methods
